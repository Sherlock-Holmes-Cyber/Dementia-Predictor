# Dementia-Predictor
The presence of dementia is predicted using XG Boost algorithm. This code is being used for future ready talent internship (Microsoft) in the year 2022. 

#Steps involved in the process
1. Finding a suitable dataset [Here, oasis-longitudinal dataset is considered]
2. A python script have been scripted to create a ML model using XG Boost classifier
3. The model is tested to beget 83% accuracy
4. In the Azure Portal a resource group have been created 
5. Then the Machine Learning service has been used and the model was saved and run in Machine Learning Studio
6. After successfully running the model, it has been deployed as a web service. 

#Oppurtunities
1. A basic ML algorithm is used to predict the presence of Dementia in an individual.
2. The detection of the disease in an early stage is possible, in a matter of seconds.
3. It will aid the medical community to a large extent, because detection at an early stage can lead to start of treatment in time.
